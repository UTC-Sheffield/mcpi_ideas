# Open the file

1. Open "4_Pictures_in_the_sky.py"
2. Run it, what does it do?

# Variables and lists.

We have used variables before but here we are using an array, a list of values.

```python
img = [
    0b00011000,
    0b00111100,
    0b01111110,
    0b11011011,
    0b11111111,
    0b00100100,
    0b01011010,
    0b10100101
    ]
```

Find this code? All the other lines that start `img = [`  do EXACTLY the same thing.
