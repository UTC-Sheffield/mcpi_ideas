# Pictures in the sky
## Using weird numbers (binary) to make big pictures

# Open the file

1. Open bitmap.py
2. Run it what does it do?

# Varialbes and list.

We have used variables before but here we are using an array , a list of values

<pre>
img = [
    0b00011000,
    0b00111100,
    0b01111110,
    0b11011011,
    0b11111111,
    0b00100100,
    0b01011010,
    0b10100101
    ]

</pre>

Find this code? All the over lines that are img = above it do EXACTLY the same thing.
